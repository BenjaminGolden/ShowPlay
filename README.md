# ShowPlay
ShowPlay is an application designed for touring musicians, athletes, and businessmen/women who frequently travel to the same cities for work. It allows the user to keep track of the unique places they visit in a specific location and save details related to the event for future reference.

## Installation
clone ```git@github.com:BenjaminGolden/ShowPlay.git```

Run ```npx create-react-app```

Run ```npm start``` from the root directory

in a separate terminal window, launch ```json-server -p 8088 -w database.json```

## Create an account
register for an account and start using the application. Since this app is meant to be used as a personal journal, only user specific data will show up on the main page. Select New Event from the nav bar and start creating new events based on the city and state you would like to save the event to.
